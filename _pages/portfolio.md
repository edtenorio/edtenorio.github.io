### Probabilistic Recommendation System
Builds a topâ€‘N recommender with uncertaintyâ€‘aware scoring: implicit feedback matrix, train/val split by time, regularized MF, and posterior-style confidence to handle coldâ€‘start risk.  
Tech: Python, pandas, implicit/ALS, evaluation@K  
[Source Code](https://github.com/edtenorio) â€¢ ![Recommender](/images/projects/recsys.png)

### Dependency Vulnerability Risk Analyzer (NVD)
Prototype tool that parses project manifests (Maven/Gradle/Python/Go), maps to CPEs, queries NVD CVEs, and produces a risk report with severity and remediation hints.  
Tech: Python, CLI, JSON, NVD data  
[Repo](https://github.com/edtenorio) â€¢ ![Risk Tool](/images/projects/deps-risk.png)
