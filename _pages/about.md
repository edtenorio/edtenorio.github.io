## About Me 

I’m a fourth-year student at the University of Arkansas majoring in Computer Engineering, with a growing passion for using statistics and machine learning to make sense of uncertainty. I’m currently preparing to pursue a master’s and eventually a Ph.D., where I hope to dive deep into research that blends data, modeling, and real-world impact.

What excites me most is the challenge of turning messy, unpredictable information into something meaningful. I love asking questions, building solutions, and learning from every failure along the way.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy watching movies, dancing(tropical dances like salsa, merengue, bachata), and I’m always up for solving a good puzzle.
