## About Me 

I’m a senior at the University of Arkansas majoring in Computer Engineering, with a growing passion for using statistics and machine learning to make sense of uncertainty. I’m currently preparing to pursue a master’s and eventually a Ph.D., where I hope to dive deep into research that combines data, modeling, and real-world impact.

What excites me most is the challenge of turning messy, unpredictable information into something meaningful. I love asking questions, building solutions, and learning from every failure along the way.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy watching movies in Italian and Portuguese (a fun way to pick up new languages), and I’m always up for solving a good puzzle. I’m endlessly curious, quietly ambitious, and driven by the idea that rigorous thinking — paired with creativity — can solve important problems.
